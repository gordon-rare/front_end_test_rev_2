# Hi There!
This repo contains a build test for applicants hoping to fill [RARE's open front-end role](https://www.seek.com.au/job/35829681?_ga=2.54111213.498531638.1521794614-1299046724.1521794614)

We expect this build will take longer than 2hrs to complete, but we don't want you to spend more time than that.

We're looking to gauge your build approach and your attention to detail.

**Quality over quantity is the key.**

Please fork this repo and commit as you go so that we can see your workings.

You're free to use whatever tools suit you best but keep it static front-end please. If you use build tools (webpack, gulp, etc) please include your raw source and build tools.

When you're done please shoot us a link so we can review.

[Please find the raw .ai design file here if you need it](https://we.tl/ZMGgLXlD8A)
